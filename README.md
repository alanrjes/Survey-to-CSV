- Enter the instructor name, which will be printed at the top of the page.
- Enter each question for the survey, clicking "Add Question" until all questions are listed.
- Click "Save and Print Survey".
- Retrieve the resulting PDF file from the "Surveys" directory.

Print the resulting survey, distribute to students, and scan completed surveys to a PDF file.

- Upload the PDF of the completed surveys.
- Select the applicable survey template.
- Click "Proceed".
- Collect the resulting CSV file from the "Scans" directory.

Upload the CSV file to the spreadsheet program of your choice to analyze the results.
