Developed by Alan Jessup

## Overview

It was developed for the purpose of gathering course evaluation feedback.

## Usage

To generate a survey:

- From the main menu, click "Create New Survey".
- Enter a title, subtitle, and instructions if desired, which will be printed at the top of the page.
- Enter each question for the survey, clicking "Add Question" until all questions are listed.
- Click "Save and Print Survey".
- Retrieve the resulting PDF file from the "print" subdirectory.

Print the resulting survey, distribute to students, and scan completed surveys to a PDF file.

- Scan one survey per page.

- Upload the PDF of the completed surveys.
